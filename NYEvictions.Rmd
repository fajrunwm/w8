## Initial project scope

Research question:
How have the eviction rate in New York City evolved over the years (2017-2023), and are there discernible temporal patterns or trends in the distribution of evictions accross different boroughs and community district?

Null hyposthesis:
There is no significant temporal variation in eviction rates accross New York City during 2017-2023. Eviction rates remains constant over time, and any observed differences are due to random fluctuations.
